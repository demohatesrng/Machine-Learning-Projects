# MNIST Digit Classifier Comparison
This project aims to compare the performance of different machine learning algorithms on the MNIST dataset for digit classification. The algorithms compared include Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest.

## Dataset
The MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). It contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

## Algorithms
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Decision Tree
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Random Forest

## The following are the accuracy scores achieved by each algorithm on the MNIST dataset:
SVM: 97% <br>
Decision Tree: 87% <br>
KNN: 94% <br>
Random Forest: 96%

##Conclusion
Based on the results, the SVM algorithm performed the best with an accuracy score of 97%, followed by Random Forest with 96%. Decision Tree had the lowest accuracy among the algorithms tested.
